    "For our final tutorial we will be analyzing homelessness in the United States. We are diving into the current state of homelessness, the change over time, and factors that have the biggest impact on homelessness. Observations that we will be looking for include total homeless population, homelessness per capita, and homeless population demographics. Furthermore, we aim to find trends in our data with variables correlating to our observations. These factors will include geographic location, local politics, and minimum wage. \n",

We will use (are currently using) Google Docs for written reports throughout the semester, then we’ll upload it to github to make sure it’s all stored together. \n",

The spreadsheet includes specific categories including total homelessness by state, breakdowns by gender and race, and status of homeless citizens (sheltered, unsheltered, etc). One question to analyze: which gender has a higher population of homelessness in Illinois?\n",

When looking at homelessness by race I noticed that White people had the highest amount of homeless people, but when you switch it to rate per 10,000 people, the category Pacific Islanders switches to the top. This goes back to in class when we talked about the importance of weighted averages. We can analyze how the history of the United States goes into the factors of who experiences homelessness in this country.\n",
