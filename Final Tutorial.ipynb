    "For our final tutorial we will be analyzing homelessness in the United States. We are diving into the current state of homelessness, the change over time, and factors that have the biggest impact on homelessness. Furthermore, we will break down our analysis on a national level and at the state level, highlighting the observations we find in Louisiana. Stats that we will be looking for include total homeless population, rate of homelessness, the population demographics. We will also look for variables correlating with the rate of homelessness at the state level. These factors will include geographic location, local politics, and minimum wage. \n",

We have a Github repository (https://github.com/chloeu99/chloeu99.github.io) to collaborate and save our coding progress. We use Google Docs for written reports, then upload it to Github to keep everything organized. In terms of coding, we will use the same strategies that we learned in class: Python coding and data scraping and the pandas library for analysis."
